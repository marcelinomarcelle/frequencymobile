I'm a 20 year radio broadcasting veteran. I have been innovating &amp; programming radio stations for the passed 2 decades of my life and I believe I have the perfect concept for the future of radio broadcasting. I just do not know how to code.
I'm looking for someone who can create something similar to Spotify.
This is frustrating, because I've had this idea in my head for over 5 years now.
